# eVeREST

## Getting Started
I assume that you already use Node.js :)
List of libraries you need to install in order to run the test suite:
```
Mocha
Chai
Request
Request-promise
```

Please note that ```mocha``` has some issues when installed not globally.
I strongly recommend installing it globally by
```npm install -g mocha```

## Running the tests

Once all dependencies are met, navigate in terminal to project folder and simply type
``` mocha ```
